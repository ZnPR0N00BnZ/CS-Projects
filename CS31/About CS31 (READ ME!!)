Hello!

CS31 is an Intro to Computer Science class offered at UCLA. It covers all the fundamentals like loops, arrays, conditional statements, etc. 
(Note: There is no project on pointers, instead students were given a quiz that tested our competency on it)

In each project folder, there will be a text file that states the important concepts I have picked up in completing that assignment.
