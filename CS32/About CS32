Hi there!

CS32 is an Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms class offered at UCLA, the most important lower-division CS class that teaches students what's mostly
needed for an internship especially in a Software Engineering specialisation.

In each project/homework folder, there will be a text file that states the important concepts I have picked up in completing that assignment.
